  Please know if the minor you seek to be appointed as a guardian has 
 
  1. parents that are deceased or incapacitated
  2. parents consent, 
  3. parents whose parental rights have been terminated, 
  4. parents who have signed a voluntary surrender, or 
  5. parents the court finds, jointly, or the surviving parent, to be unavailable or unfit to have custody. 
  
  What documents should you bring? 
  
  - Any evidence of harm to the minor that would support your verified Motion for Appointment of Temporary Guardian (MPC 340) if you need court authority quickly (i.e. an affidavit containing facts supporting the statements and requests in the motion)
  
  WHAT YOU NEED 
  
  - To file for guardianship of a minor in person, you should bring your completed forms to the Probate and Family Court in the county where the child lives, unless there is already an ongoing case involving the child in a Juvenile Court or District Court.
  - To request to become the guardian of a minor, you'll need to file:
  - Petition for Appointment of Guardian of a Minor (MPC 140)
  Affidavit Disclosing Care and Custody (OCAJ-1)
  - Bond (MPC 801)
  - Either a petition or affidavit: 
      
      1. If the parent(s) agree with the appointment of the guardian — Notarized Waiver and Consent to Petition (MPC 440)
      2. If the parents and interested parties disagree with the appointment of the guardian - Notice of Appearance (and Objection) (MPC 505a)

template: after_filing_instruction
subject: |
    What steps do you need to take after completing and filing this form?
content: |
  
  * Please note, You must print, sign, and file this form at the Probate and Family Court in the county where the child lives with a Bond (MPC 801) attached. (please visit for more information: 
  https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-for-guardianship-of-a-minor) 
  
  * Additionally, you must submit an Affidavit Disclosing Care and Custody (OCAJ-1)
  Either a petition or affidavit:
  
      - If the parent(s) agree with the appointment of the guardian — Notarized Waiver and Consent to Petition (MPC 440)
      - If the parents and interested parties disagree with the appointment of the guardian - Notice of Appearance (and Objection) (MPC 505a)
  
  What steps do you need to take after completing and filing this form?
  
  1. The court will send or give you a Notice and Order form. This form tells you when your court hearing will be and the people who need to be sent notice. 
  2. You will need to give notice by providing copies of the Petition and the Order and Notice to the interested parties, which includes:
  
      * The child's parents. 
      * If the parents are deceased, the child's nearest relatives are over age 18. However, you don't need to send notice to a parent whose rights have been terminated.
      * The child, if the child is 14 or older
      * Any current guardian or conservator for the child
      * Anyone the child has lived with during the past 60 days, except foster parents. 
      * If the Department of Children and Families (DCF) has custody of the child, they must be notified too.
      * The United States Veterans Administration if the child is entitled to any benefits
  
  3. You will then need to attend the hearing.
  
      * The Notice and Order will have a hearing date
      * At the hearing, the minor child has the right to have a lawyer to represent them. If the minor can't afford a lawyer, the court can order that the minor's lawyer be paid by the state. 
      * The minor or someone acting on their behalf can ask the court to appoint a lawyer for them. 
      * If the minor or person acting on their behalf asks for a lawyer, the court must appoint an attorney. 
  
  If you are a parent of a minor child who is the subject of the guardianship of a minor case, you have a right to be represented by an attorney. If you would like an attorney and can't afford to pay for one and you give proof that you're indigent, an attorney will be assigned to you. 
  
  If you want an attorney, you must immediately request one in person or by mail to the court location where your case will be held.
  
  At the court hearing, the court will determine if:
  
    - You are qualified
    - The case is in the right court
    - The required notices have been given
    - The basic conditions for an appointment have been met
    - The requested appointment provides for the welfare and best interest of the child
  
  The court will make the appointment on a court form (“Decree and Order of Appointment of Guardian of a Minor”) and issues a letter of appointment. 
  
  If the court cannot make a final determination at this hearing, a temporary decree of guardianship may be granted, and another court date will be scheduled.
